more recipes for minecraft 1.16 take the folder inside the "main" folder out first
some are a stretch but i do what i want so you can make spawners and some spawn eggs 3 
chainmal armor using chain 
crying obsidian by placing water bucket in middle and rest obsidian and just found out the rest 
you can smelt gravel for flint (if i had something better it wouldnt be furnace)


any issues or requests i will check. if alot of people dont like a crafting feature i have made (no i wont remove the spawners i will only change the recipe if people think its to cheap it was all a rough thought in my head and yes chainmail is more expensive then iron im working on that but it all feels wrong  
work in progress i will add images of the recipes (i dont know how to make it so the recipe will unlock when getting one of the items
